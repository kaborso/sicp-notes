## Covers Text Section 2.1
[Introduction to Data Abstraction](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-14.html)

Buidling a layered system (1:15)

When building things, we divorce the task of building the thing from that of implementing the parts (2:25)

The pattern of Primatives, Means of Combination, Means of Abstraction also applies to data (2:42)

### Example: System of Arithmetic for Rational Numbers (3:35)
* Formulas for adding and multiplying fractions (4:25)
* Need a method to represent rational numbers (5:25)
* Can develop the procedures to interact with rationals even without knowing the details of the represenation (6:30)
* Can develop the procedures to add and multiply based on the procedures to interact with rationals (8:05)
* Constructors and Selectors are what makes using wishful thinking with data possble (11:05)
* Why write the procedures to take 2 rational numbers instead of taking 2 numerators and 2 denominators (12:04)
* Hiding the internals of the implementation makes it easier to use the procedures for adding and mulitplying rationals as part of a larger system (13:08)
* Creating the representation of rational numbers with constructor and selectors is exactly the same idea as creating and naming procedures to represent operations (16:00)
